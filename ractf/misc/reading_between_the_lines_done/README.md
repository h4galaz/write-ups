# Reading Between the Lines

## 3 00 points - First solved by david

We found a strange file knocking around, but I've got no idea who wrote it because the indentation's an absolute mess!

`main.c - 833 Bytes`

## Steps
Lets look at the provided file.
There we can find some basic `C syntax` but with weird spacing..

There are some `esoteric programming languages` one of them is based on whitespace.
Lets give it a try with a [online interpreter](https://vii5ard.github.io/whitespace/).

Boom we got the flag.
